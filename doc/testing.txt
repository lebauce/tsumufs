Functionality testing should be done using the os_mock and
os_path_mock modules somehow. Need a way to inject os_mock and
os_path_mock into the various modules in TsumuFS -- this will allow us
to move away from the NFS server dependency for testing, and allow us
to write some decent regression tests.
