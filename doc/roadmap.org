* [1/15] v1.0 - Prototype FUSE+Python version
  - [ ] Feature parity in terms of syscalls to NFS.
    - [X] Initial NFS passthrough.
    - [ ] Re-routing of syscalls to the NFSMount object.

  - [ ] Prototypical NFS sanity checking and disconnect/reconnect
        notification.
    - [ ] NFSMount syscall behavior changing based upon the status of
          the NFS backend connection
    - [ ] NFSMount syscall failures triggering a remount.

  - [ ] Prototypical caching operation
    - [ ] Reads cause caching of files to disk. No quota checking.
    - [ ] No reading or writing of cachespec files yet. Use hardcoded
          values.

  - [ ] Prototypical synclog operation
    - [ ] Writes going to the synclog and cache directly
    - [ ] Basic re-integration upstream (no merging functionality --
          conflicts handled entirely by the user)

  - [ ] User space communication
    - [ ] Basic notifications to userspace, no commands accepted yet.
    - [ ] Reference implementation of the notification tool written.

* [0/13] v2.0 - Feature complete FUSE+Python version
  - [ ] Finalized NFS sanity checking and disconnect/reconnect
        notification.
        - [ ] Manual disconnected mode triggerable via the userspace
              socket.
        - [ ] NFS sanity checking implemented fully.
        - [ ] NFS flapping case checked for.

  - [ ] Caching operation complete.
    - [ ] Cache quota checking implemented.
    - [ ] Persistant caching and nevercaching implemented.
    - [ ] Reading and writing of cachespec files is complete.

  - [ ] Finalized synclog operation.
    - [ ] Automatic reintegration done when possible, only binary
          conflicts are passed to the user.

  - [ ] User space communication finalized.
    - [ ] All user-facing events are notified via the userspace
          socket.
    - [ ] Full implementation of a userspace control program
          implemented.
