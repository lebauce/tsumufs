Reporting Bugs
==============

If you're interested in helping out with development by testing and
sending in bug reports, you'll need to do several things.

  - Try running the latest development copy of the code from
    subversion and see if your issue has been solved there first.

  - Look through the existing issues on
    <http://code.google.com/p/tsumufs/issues> to see if the bug has
    already been reported. If so, simply attach your additional
    information to the end of the bug report.

  - Figure out what it was you expected, and what the actual behavior
    was.

  - Gather the steps you took to cause the bug, and write them in a
    clean, concise manner. Without steps, fixing the bug is next to
    impossible.

  - Run the included utils/gen-bug-report script to generate debug
    information about your specific system, and include it in the
    bug report.

  - File the bug at <http://code.google.com/p/tsumufs/issues/entry>.

  - Go grab a can/glass of $BEVERAGE, and enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling
    you get from participating. =o)

    -or-

    Look into the issue further, find a solution (or workaround),
    generate a patch in unified diff format against the current
    development copy in subversion, and attach it to the bug. =o)

Please be aware that bug reports that essentially boil down to "it
doesn't work" without any supporting evidence or information about how
to reproduce the issue will be immediately closed and not even looked
at in any detail.

Please understand that this is not done in arrogance or anger -- these
kinds of bug reports don't help the development process, and the
developers don't generally have enough time to walk users through the
process of submitting a good bug report.

In general, the rule of thumb for bug reports is that if you take time
to submit a well written bug, the developers will be more inclined to
take time to see about fixing it.
