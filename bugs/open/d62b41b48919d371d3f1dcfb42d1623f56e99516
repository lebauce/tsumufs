description: !!python/unicode 'To make sure that data changes are merged properly,
  instead of digging through

  the entire synclog queue to find the appropriate change record, or adding a new

  syncitem to the queue, we should instead check the inode changes hash first, and

  if one exists for the same inode, we should add another region to it. Since the

  changes list and the inodechanges list are kept in sync atomically (via locks)

  if a change exists in the inodechanges hash, then we know that there''s a change

  in the queue.'
