TsumuFS: an NFS caching layer
=============================

Testing Notes
=============

To actually get tsumufs to test properly with FUSE, you have to add
the a bit of code similar to the following to /etc/sudoers via visudo:

  %fuse $HOSTNAME=NOPASSWD: /bin/mount *
  %fuse $HOSTNAME=NOPASSWD: /bin/umount *

Replace $HOSTNAME with the FQDN of your machine, or ALL if you don't
care specifically about machine security. Once this is added, add
yourself to the fuse group and you should be able to run tsumufs
without issues.

Currently this is horribly insecure, but we know of no other secure
way to get the prototype the root privileges to mount another
filesystem.

We've provided two additional scripts in the 'utils' directory, one
called `test' and the other called `xattr'.

test allows you to easily start the test environment. Simply set
the environmental variable NFSHOME to the path you give the mount
command as the source, and NFSOPTS to whatever NFS options you usually
give to mount. Provide the destination mount point on the command line
and you should be set.
