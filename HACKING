Please keep in mind that while hacking on TsumuFS, one should attempt to
observe the following rules:

  1. All classes must have unit tests.
  2. Commits must pass pychecker and unit test requirements.

Please use the following coding style guide:

  - Attempt to follow 100 column line length guides. Note that this is
    a soft guideline -- if a line is more readable past 100 lines,
    feel free to do so, but keep this as sparingly as possible.
  - Tabs and indents are two (2) spaces, no tabs whatsoever.

With that said, happy hacking!
