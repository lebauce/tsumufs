class View(tsumufs.Debuggable):
  '''
  Base class for tsumufs views development.
  Tsumufs views are virtual directories that provides custom presentation
  of the overlay files like sorting, custom appearance, staring, etc.
  This is possible since tsumufs based on CouchedFilesystem api from the
  python-ufo library that manage the metadatas of the filesystem in a
  CouchDb database.

  A tsumufs view is based on a python-ufo view, the minimal code required
  is the following:

    # Import the python-ufo view class
    from ufo.views import SortedByTypeSyncDocument

    class SortedByTypeView(View):

      # Name the view
      name = "Sorted by type"

      # Specify the levels of the view. Levels are the representation of
      # the depth levels of the view file tree.
      #
      # For the view that sort files by mimetype, an example tree could be:
      #
      # - "Sorted By Type" - "application"
      #                           - "pdf"
      #                           - "doc"
      #                           - "x-directory"
      #
      #                    - "text"
      #                           - "xml"
      #                           - "plain"
      #                           - "python"
      #                           - "x-empty"
      #
      levels = ['category', 'type']

      # Specify the python-ufo views class imported at head
      docClass = SortedByTypeSyncDocument

    # Assign the tsumufs view class to the global variable viewClass
    # to allow to the view loader to know which class has to be
    # instantiated at startup.
    viewClass = SortedByTypeView

  All system calls could be called on a view instance by the views manager,
  so its could be overridden to provides a custom behavior in each view.
  If a system call is'nt overridden in the view class, the default system
  call for all view will be call.

  At the user side, views are accessible in the overlay mount point,
  in the directory specified by the tsumufs mount option 'viewspoint'.

    the path nodes after the root directory of the view.

     - When the number of levels of the path is equal or higher than the

       contained in the filesystem. It's also called the 'file' level.

       the views ones, documents returned are virtual folders that does'nt
